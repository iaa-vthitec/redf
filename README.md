# BCOE / REDF Pre-Apprenticeship Curriculum

<hr>

## Project Overview

Create a trauma-informed pre-apprenticeship curriculum to prepare program participants to enter a Registered
Apprenticeship Program (RAP) with a sponsoring employer. This curriculum includes two programs, Digital Literacy and
Technical Skills. The Digital Literacy curriculum was designed to establish a foundation in using modern digital
computing devices in a guided and approachable manner. The second program, Technical Skills builds on that foundation to
provide students with the prerequisite skill set necessary to enter a Registered Apprenticeship Program in a technical
computer support occupation. The instructional approach should prioritize best-practices in trauma-informed training.

## Curriculum Site

Curriculum materials are available for viewing by the instructor at the following URL:
