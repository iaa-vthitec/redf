Digital literacy is the ability to navigate our digital world using reading, writing, technical skills, and critical thinking. It\u2019s using technology\u2014like a smartphone, PC, e-reader, and more\u2014to find, evaluate, and communicate information. By developing Digital Literacy skills, you can effectively use technology to explore the Internet. - Microsoft What Are Best Practices in Digital Literacy? Begin with direct instruction for computer skills development but quickly move beyond it and require relevant use of instructed skills in support of other learning. Traditional explanation, modeling, and controlled activities can help students understand and develop basic skills. If they do not have a chance to use the skills, they will likely not be able to transfer the skills to relevant contexts outside of the classroom. Ensure that students know relevant vocabulary to support their computer use. If students are to understand instructions, ask questions, and follow directions when using computers and other technologies, they need to know the vocabulary associated with computer components and software, their functions, and the tasks accomplished by their use. Allow ample opportunity for self-directed work that enables students to make choices when applying their computer skills and dealing with challenges that arise. Although direct instruction on discrete skills can be helpful, the teacher should quickly provide relevant application activities. Meet students where they are, offering opportunities to learn new computer skills or work toward higher-level digital literacy competencies as they become ready. Many adults do not access the internet in their daily lives due to perceived lack of relevance (Pew Center for Research Survey, 2013). Instruction in a group setting must be highly differentiated to overcome students\u2019 feeling that computer skills are not for them. You can get a sense of a student\u2019s skills by administering modules from the Northstar Digital Literacy Assessment (which are available at no cost) or another similar assessment or by using a checklist of essential classroom computer skills. This will allow you to focus your work with students on the particular skills they need, and you can update the checklist as students demonstrate the skills on the initial list.

After each instructor meeting, participants have self-study work to complete that complements the current topics. The curriculum that was selected for the instructor-led component is the Digital Access and Resilience in Texas (DART) curriculum, and the digital learning platform selected for the self-study activities is LinkedIn Learning. Both are described below. Instructor-Led Lessons A search and review of existing digital literacy curriculum yielded a plethora of content. The selected is the Digital Access and Resilience in Texas (DART) curriculum that integrates beginning English language learning with foundational digital skills. The curriculum is intended to supplement existing English language instruction if the participant requires additional ESL work. The curriculum is designed with this target audience in mind, thus is appropriate for the expected use. The DART curriculum provides the foundational English language and digital literacy skills that lower-level English language learners need to recognize and type the wide variety of characters required for most online passwords. The curriculum focuses on teaching students the skills necessary to accomplish eight major \"milestones\" on the way to successfully creating and logging in and out of an online account. Each of the curriculum milestones has associated prerequisite digital literacy and English language knowledge and skills that are summarized in Appendix A. DART Introduction and Appendices License The authors chose to copyright the DART curricula under the creative commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-Share Alike CC BY-NC-SA. This gives others permission to modify the curriculum with credit given to the authors for non-commercial use. For additional information on the curriculum's copyright, please read the license deed and the legal code . Foundational Digital Literacy Skills Included in the DART Curriculum: Recognizing and typing the names of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and common symbols on a computer and smartphone keyboard. Turning on and shutting down a computer and putting it into and waking it up from sleep mode. Checking for/connecting to a wireless network and logging in and out of a computer. Opening and closing an app from the desktop, taskbar, and the taskbar search bar. Minimizing, maximizing, restoring down, moving, and resizing app windows. Typing in a website address into a browser website address bar, using the scroll bar, and clicking on hyperlinked text and images. Practicing basic digital security by avoiding web page advertisements. Performing a simple Internet search, clicking on a result, and returning to the search results using the browser back arrow. Creating a compliant username and complex password that is easy to remember for a Gmail account. Logging in and out of an account using a compliant username and complex password. Identifying and avoiding opening links in suspect emails and text messages. Identifying basic troubleshooting techniques. Digital Learning Modules (self-study activities) The digital learning platform selected for the self-study component is LinkedIn Learning. It is recommended to purchase account access to this platform for participants. However, if the budget does not permit this, there are digital literacy videos that Microsoft produced on LinkedIn Learning that are available without a subscription. I\u2019ve used this platform for many years and appreciate the breadth and depth of content available on a range of topics (i.e., the subscription can be leveraged for other phases of the curriculum). The selected videos are: 1. Learning Typing Description: Stop the time-consuming hunting and pecking at the keyboard and learn how to type properly. In this course, you'll discover the advantages of knowing how to type, find out where your fingers should be positioned and which finger to use on each key, practice your positioning, and learn how to type for speed and accuracy. Instructor Anson Alexander will also show how to use a numeric keypad properly and measure your success, and our unique visuals allow you to see his fingers at work. Start now and learn to type your way to clearer, quicker communications, and use the course's game-like, interactive exercise file to practice each typing lesson and gauge your improvement. Learning objectives: Summarize the most effective posture to utilize during typing. Identify the advantages of the DVORAK keyboard layout. Explain where your hands should rest on the keyboard. Summarize the process for effectively typing capital letters. Recall which finger should be used to press the function, control, option, and command keys. Identify the hand position used when typing using the numeric keypad. Video Source 2. Working with Computers and Devices Technology has become intertwined with nearly every aspect of our lives.
