<p>The curriculum includes two primary modes of learning, 1) instructor-led discussions with guided activities, and 2) self-study activities consisting of digital learning modules (short videos followed by quizzes on the content). After each instructor meeting, participants have self-study work to complete that  complements the current topics.
The curriculum that was selected for the instructor-led component is the Digital Access and Resilience in Texas (DART) curriculum, and the digital learning platform selected for the self-study activities is LinkedIn Learning. Both are described below. </p>
<hr />
<h3 id="instructor-led-lessons">Instructor-Led Lessons</h3>
<p>A search and review of existing digital literacy curriculum yielded a plethora of content. The selected is the Digital Access and Resilience in Texas (DART) curriculum that integrates beginning English language learning with foundational digital skills. The curriculum is intended to supplement existing English language instruction if the participant requires additional ESL work. The curriculum is designed with this target audience in mind, thus is appropriate for the expected use. </p>
<p>The DART curriculum provides the foundational English language and digital literacy skills that lower-level English language learners need to recognize and type the wide variety of characters required for most online passwords. The curriculum focuses on teaching students the skills necessary to accomplish eight major "milestones" on the way to successfully creating and logging in and out of an online account. Each of the curriculum milestones has associated prerequisite digital literacy and English language knowledge and skills that are summarized in Appendix A.

<p><img src="../img/LinkedIn_Learning_logo.png"></p>
<p>The digital learning platform selected for the self-study component is LinkedIn Learning. It is recommended to purchase account access to this platform for participants. However, if the budget does not permit this, there are digital literacy videos that Microsoft produced on LinkedIn Learning that are available without a subscription. Iâ€™ve used this platform for many years and appreciate the breadth and depth of content available on a range of topics (i.e., the subscription can be leveraged for other phases of the curriculum). </p>
<p><strong><em>The selected videos are:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Learning Typing</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Description:</em></strong> Stop the time-consuming hunting and pecking at the keyboard and learn how to type properly. In this course, you'll discover the advantages of knowing how to type, find out where your fingers should be positioned and which finger to use on each key, practice your positioning, and learn how to type for speed and accuracy. Instructor Anson Alexander will also show how to use a numeric keypad properly and measure your success, and our unique visuals allow you to see his fingers at work. Start now and learn to type your way to clearer, quicker communications, and use the course's game-like, interactive exercise file to practice each typing lesson and gauge your improvement.</p>
<p><strong><em>Learning objectives:</em></strong> Summarize the most effective posture to utilize during typing.
